The Celo Build Rewards Campaign has significantly bolstered the ecosystem by:Attracting Talent: Programs like Builder Rewards and Proof of Ship draw developers to Celo, fostering innovation in DeFi, ReFi, and social impact projects.
Driving Network Value: By rewarding onchain activity, the campaign increases transaction volume, gas fees, and token bridging, contributing to Celo’s treasury growth. CeloPG Season 1 aims for 70% of active projects to benefit from at least one program.

Enhancing Financial Inclusion: Initiatives like USDGLO Flywheel and GoodDollar’s program support stablecoin integration, making financial tools accessible in emerging markets.
Fostering Community Engagement: The campaign encourages collaboration through platforms like Gitcoin and Farcaster, with 50,000 CELO allocated for CeloPG & Farcaster to promote mini-app development.

Since CeloPG’s launch in Q1 2024, it has coordinated over $3 million in resources, supporting builders across 150+ countries and driving Celo’s transition to an Ethereum Layer 2 chain using Optimism’s OP Stack.
