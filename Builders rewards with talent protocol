Builders are rewarded based on verified onchain and open-source contributions, such as:Deploying verified smart contracts on Celo.

Reward Structure: Rewards are distributed across three tiers:Tier 1: Top 10 builders share 50% of the reward pool.
Tier 2: Next 25 builders share 25% of the pool.
Tier 3: Next 65 builders share the remaining 25%.

Eligibility: Builders must have a Human Checkmark verification on Talent Protocol, at least one Celo transaction, and comply with anti-money laundering and sanctions laws. Rewards are calculated based on activity on verified contracts, GitHub contributions, and Builder Score, with no application process required. The program runs monthly, with rewards distributed on the first business day of the following month (e.g., June 2, 2025, for May contributions).
