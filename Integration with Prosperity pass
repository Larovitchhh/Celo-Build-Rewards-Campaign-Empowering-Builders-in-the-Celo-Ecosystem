The Celo Build Rewards Campaign is closely tied to Prosperity Pass, Celo’s smart account wallet that tracks onchain contributions via Soulbound Tokens (SBTs). Builders can level up their Prosperity Pass by earning badges for activities like deploying contracts, participating in governance, or contributing to ReFi initiatives. In CeloPG Season 1, 100,000 CELO in Seasonal Contributor Rewards are allocated based on Prosperity Pass badges, curated with the Celo Foundation’s Growth team. This integration enhances transparency and rewards builders for their ecosystem impact.
