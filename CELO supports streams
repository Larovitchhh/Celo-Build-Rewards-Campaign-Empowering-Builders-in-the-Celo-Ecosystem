Celo Support Streams distribute 100,000 CELO biweekly through a s0CELO vote on the CeloPG Aragon deployment, running from May 19 to July 30, 2025. This program incentivizes protocol-level contributions, rewarding builders who enhance Celoâ€™s infrastructure or drive network adoption. In CeloPG Season 1, Support Streams will use stCELO for continuous voting, ensuring productive capital allocation.
