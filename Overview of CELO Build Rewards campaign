The Celo Build Rewards Campaign is a multifaceted initiative designed to accelerate the development of projects within the Celo ecosystem. Launched under the umbrella of CeloPG, the campaign encompasses a variety of programs that reward builders for their contributions, from deploying smart contracts to integrating stablecoins and fostering community engagement. With a focus on retroactive funding, grants, and automated rewards, the campaign supports both new and existing projects, encouraging innovation in areas like ReFi, dApps, and onchain governance.Key programs within the campaign include Builder Rewards, Proof of Ship, Celo Support Streams, Proof of Impact, USDGLO Flywheel, and GoodDollarâ€™s Builders Program. These initiatives collectively distribute millions in rewards, including CELO, cUSD, USDGLO, and OP tokens, to builders who drive value for the Celo network. By leveraging tools like Karma GAP, EasyRPGF, and Spinach.fi, the campaign ensures transparent and efficient reward allocation.
