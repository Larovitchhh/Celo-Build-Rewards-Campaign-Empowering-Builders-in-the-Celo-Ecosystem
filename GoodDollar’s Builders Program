GoodDollarâ€™s Builders Program, announced in March 2025, offers 250,000 in rewards and grants across three Gitcoin Grants rounds. The first round, open from April 1 to April 6, 2025, welcomes both new and existing Celo projects. Builders with live products can earn additional rewards through the Engagement Rewards SDK, based on unique user interactions. Mentors also distribute 20,000 in rewards per round to their favorite builders, fostering community-driven support.
