Proof of Ship is a monthly AI-powered contest that rewards builders for demonstrating progress and impact on Celo. Running from February to July 2025, the program allocates 30,000 cUSD monthly to projects meeting milestones reported through Karma GAP and reviewed by Celo’s DevRel team. Builders can grow their onchain reputation and earn up to 15,000 cUSD per month by showcasing real contributions, such as deploying dApps or integrating Celo’s infrastructure.
